# ZhinNX Philosophy

## Simplicity Over Abstraction

We believe in writing code that is close to the platform. No complex build steps, no unnecessary abstractions.

## Performance First

Every feature is designed with performance in mind. From Zero-Build to Streaming SSR, we prioritize speed.

## Explicit API

We prefer explicit APIs over implicit magic. You should always know what your code is doing.
